          A website's links are buried in pages of content and obscured by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">vague hypertext</a>.
          Who knows where a link leads? Is it relevant? A waste of time?

            >most pages have a great many links</a

          miss the links that are worth exploring. This on top of the persistent
          nuisance of interacting with popups, distracting signup buttons, and
          cookie banners that fill the landscape of the modern web.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need a new way to see how a website is situated without needing to
          fully focus on each page. A method that takes the same amount of
          effort as skimming a page but with the many possible new directions to
          go that a full read of a page yields.

        <h2>We need a way to browse between websites non-linearly.</h2>
        <p>
          Since the very first internet browsers, there's only been one way to
          navigate between pages. Click a link, and the new page fills the
          browser. Click another link and the process repeats. One page at a
          time, one after another.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we don't think like this. We hold the pages we've already visited
          in memory, a kind of a history that gives context to where we are now.
          As we continue to browse,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load"
            >cognitive load</a
          >
          increases, eventually we

            >forget all but the first and last couple of pages</a
          >
          that brought us to the present page.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need a way to offload this effort by providing
          <a
            href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Minard.png"
            >a visual representation of history</a

          while also showing the many branches of exploration that naturally
          arise over the course of browsing.

        <h2>
          We need a better way to discover new websites and explore the
          internet.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The primary way we find new websites is by typing a query into the Big
          G. It yields results from everywhere around the internet, optimizing
          for
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/"
            >some obscure notion of quality</a
          >, and even what
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Personalized_Search"
            >the searcher would find most engaging</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engines are designed to place information first, both as the
          goal of a search and the content that's returned. Due to the massive
          amount of information on the internet, a search engine is an
          inherently complicated system who's internal workings are made opaque
          to those that use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need simpler, more understandable systems that aren't optimized for
          engagement or even accuracy. Rather than finding information, we need
          systems that help us find new directions that stimulate our curiosity.
          A system for exploratory queries, not informational ones.

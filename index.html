          A website's external links provide context and opportunity to explore,
          yet they're never seen as one collection.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Links are buried in content and obscured by vague hypertext. But
          they're the key to moving quickly between websites and finding new
          destinations. We need a new way to see how a website is situated
          without needing interact with popups, distracting signup buttons, and
          cookie banners.

          Navigating around a website is a slow process. It takes time to find
          what you're looking for, move to the next page, scan it, and repeat
          the process. We need a new way to browse that allows for exploration
          down multiple paths, preserving context over time.

          Even though the Big G knows all our preferences, it still feeds us
          trashy-clickbait-popup-filled websites as primary search results. It
          attempts to build a global measure of quality, not an individual one.
          As we browse we develop a cluster of content we've seen, think is
          higher quality, and can use to search from again.
